# Python
The program may be small but it will maintain a users attention for quite some time. Once the game is ran the program will initialize with a question asking the users name. Once entered the game will begin. It will ask the user to guess a number 1-100 that is randomly chosen at the start. If the users guess is too low it will return the value entered and tells them if the correct answer is higher or lower. Once the users has guessed the correct answer the program will output a congratulations message and returns the number of guesses taken. Overall, this was a fun project and help me learn the ins and outs of python.
