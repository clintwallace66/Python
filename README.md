# Python Guessing Game

The program may be small but it will maintain a users attention for quite some time. Once the game is ran the program will initialize with a question asking the users name. Once entered the game will begin. It will ask the user to guess a number 1-100 that is randomly chosen at the start. If the users guess is too low it will return the value entered and tells them if the correct answer is higher or lower. Once the users has guessed the correct answer the program will output a congratulations message and returns the number of guesses taken. Overall, this was a fun project and help me learn the ins and outs of python.  

The program is an interactive guessing game, which will ask the user to guess a
number between 1 and 100. 

The Program uses the random module with the randint function to get a random number. 

It also contains a while loop, which make the script run until the user
guess the right number.
